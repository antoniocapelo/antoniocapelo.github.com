##On Getting the Degree

Hi! 
My most recent excuse for the lack of posts is that I was too busy working at [blip.pt](http://www.blip.pt) and finishing my college degree at the same time. On the next paragraphs, I'll talk a little bit about it, you can skip that part if you know the 'story'.

On the [second half of the post](#secondhalf) there's some photos I took while on Sicily with some good friends. We rented a car, travelled around the island and I snapped some moments with my new (long awaited) camera), the [Fuji X100](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/FujifilmX100) - which will be properly reviewed later. Enjoy!

<p style="font-size: 80%">PS: I started using <a href="https://www.copy.com">copy</a> and decided to test it as the hosting solution for my images, let's see how it goes.</p>

<style type="text/css">
	.speech.collapsed {
		max-height: 0;
	}

	.speech {
		max-height: 3000px;
		transition: all 0.85s ease;
		overflow: hidden;
	}

	.expand-speech {
		background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
		border: 1px solid #EEE;
		padding: 1rem;
		font-size: 0.9rem;
		font-family: 'PT serif';
	}

</style>

<div class="speech collapsed">
	<p>For those who don't know it, about 3 years ago I was a Civil Engineer, working on my second year as a Engineer at <a href="http://casais.pt/" target="_blank">Casais Engenharia</a>. I was part of the percentage who had a job but wasn't happy nor feeling remotely accomplished with it. Even working as a structure engineer, designing projects wasn't enough for me. I've always had a lot of curiosity about programming, mainly web development. Although I didn't have any experience with it, I felt I could be good at it and, even more importantly, be happy doing it for a living.
	</p>

	<p>So I took a 'leap of faith' and quit my job, studied for a National Exam and applied for the <a href="www.di.uminho.pt/ensino/licenciaturas/lei" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering</a> degree. </p>

	<p>It was a great sacrifice at many levels. The obvious one was not getting paid. Loosing some of my independency, beeing away from the work market and starting a new degree at the age of 25 was not easy as well. Besides that, there's always a small doubt about whether I've made the right decision; and it's hard to fit it when surrounded with so many younger students with different life goals (naturally).</p>

	<p>Luckily, I had a family, friends and girlfriend who helped and motivated me throughout these years. Without them it would have been way harder!</p>

	<p>In order to earn some money and experience I did some freelance work building some small websites while I studied a lot.</p>

	<p>But I must say that a turning point was begining to work as a web developer at <b>blip</b>. They made me feel welcome and made me want to learn even more. I grew a lot while having fun! It's been over a year since I started there, I'm still learning and still loving what I do. I had to finish the last year of the degree while working, which wasn't easy, but was definitely worth it. </p>

	<p><b>I guess what I mean is:</b> it's hard to leave some things 'on hold' and rewind some years of your life to go after what you feel right. But it's even harder not to.</p>
