My first photography exposition is ready and waiting for your feedback!

It's a collection of some shots of my first approach to street photography, most of them taken place in the city of Porto.

So, if you're on the neighborhood of Porto and you wanna see some raw street photography (and, who knows, buy a piece of original clothing), come by the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/absolutribut">Absolutribut</a> store from 12-09 to 24-09!
