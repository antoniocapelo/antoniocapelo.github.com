Want a little bit of summer pictures + street shots? Let's go then!

AH! Not so fast. IF you're in the surroundings of Porto, be sure to see my very humble photography exhibition entitled "When the glass is broken". It's on from 13th August to the middle of September on <em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Absolutribut/160638603975720">Absolutribut</a>.</em> So you get to see a little bit of street photography and some nice second hand &amp; vintage clothing!

On to the next subject:

First roll - <strong>Agfa Vista 100</strong> (expired in 2011) was shot with the <strong>Olympus XA2</strong>, one of the cutest cameras I own. I really need to buy nice color rolls, this ones were cheap enough to test the new cameras and as a last resource when I'm out of film, but they don't do justice to the gear their in. It's not that I don't like the colors, they're as expected for a *cheap* and expired film, some of the photos got a special look because of it (real life instagram, boy!), but they're not very even.. Plus, the developed film has too many "white dots" on it and I'm yet to find if it's the film's fault, or the low-cost photo lab's fault… That makes me want to start developing color film =/ Next agfa will be developed in another lab, just to make things clear (and dot-free).

More interesting stuff:by looking to some of my last pictures taken with the Canonet QL-17, which 80% came inclined, I thought one of two things:

1) I'm <em>drunk</em> everytime I use that camera, or

2) the framing lines are misplaced.

So then I did a quick visit to Mr. Adriano - the machine wizard - workshop, to get my rangefinder fixed. For these shots, the light was low, so I had to use a tripod. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">His</span> tripod ;D

Some weeks ago, the <a href="http://we-love-film.com/">We Love Film</a> project received a new film, the <strong>Protopan400</strong>, and I ordered some rolls to test it. There's little information on it online, few or none reviews, but at least they got us a development table =P I used it with it's original ISO, 400, developed it in Rodinal for 10 minutes n 20ºC (or so). I found it a nice film, I wish it were a little bit more contrasty, as some of the frames came out a bit 'flat', but next time I think i'll push it to get more contrast.
