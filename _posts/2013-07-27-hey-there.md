`Hello, World!`

I'm Ant√≥nio Capelo, young web developer who got a bit tired of using WP to update his <a href="http://www.antoniocapelo.com/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>. You can read more <a href="about" target="_blank">about me</a> or check my personal website at <a href="http://www.antoniocapelo.com/">www.antoniocapelo.com</a>.
So, this the first web post using this *jekyll system* and test the **markdown** syntax. The usual test post, just to see out it looks and blush with pride :)

Some opion I collected:

> This blog spits hot fire
>
> That sh*t cray!

The people have talked. Seems legit.
