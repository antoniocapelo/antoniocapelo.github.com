# Showing some react ❤️ 

Last june I talked a bit about react at [TechInPorto](www.techinporto.com) conference, why we use it as a main tool for building User Interfaces at [MOXY](https://moxy.studio/) and why we reach some sanity while using it. 

It was a tricky talk to prepare since I didn't know the level of React profiency the audience had, so I tried to write a bit for both types of audiences: a simple react introduction together with a *hands on*  part.

> As web developers, we’ve come a long way when it comes to Frontend.
> We’ll time-travel a bit and remember what problems we used to tackle, how we overcame them and what issues we’re dealing with now.
> I’ll be talking about imperative VS functional approaches to building UI, how we can use React to increase productivity and testability, and how that gets us closer to a sane frontend development.
> (There’ll be a live demo. I may screw up.)
