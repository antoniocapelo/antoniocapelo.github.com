Last week I made a quick *To Do List* kind-of app, based on AngularJS. I did that so that I could pratice some unit testing with jasmine, filtering, and some css styling. I also had to have some persistence system for the data, so I tried using the browser's localStorage for that.
The main HTML structure I imagined (besides containers for styling purposes) was:

* an `<input>` of text type for the insertion
* an `<ul>` to list each 'to do', represented as an `<li>` element
* each element would have an `<input>` of type checkbox to check if the 'to do' was completed
* a footer with a 'cleaner' button, some filters and a counter of todos left

So, the main steps were:

### 'To Do' model and Collection

Each to do was defined as an object, with the the following structure :

	newTodo= {
		id: // number: todo-key,
        text : // string: todo-description,
        done : // boolean: either completed or not
    };

And the 'to do' collection was represented as an array, assigned to the **todos** variable in the controller's scope.

### 'To Do' Insertion

As expected, an insertTodo function was defined in the controller's scope so that the user could insert new items, being abstracted from its' ID or state:

	    
    $scope.insertTodo = function (todotext) {
        var newTodo;
        if (todotext.length) {
			newTodo= {
				id: $scope.todos.length ? $scope.todos[$scope.todos.length - 1].id + 1 : 1,
                text : todotext,
                done : false
            };
            // insert into collection
            $scope.todos.push(newTodo);
            // reset input text
            $scope.newTodoText = '';
            $scope.$apply();
            saveData();
        }
    };

### State update and visual feedback

Like any AngularJS app, updating the model state is as easy as binding each item's **done** atribute with the `<input>` element, with the `ng-model` directive. That would sync the todo's state, but for this use case the 'tick' of the checkbox isn't enough to indicate that the item is completed, a **line-through** text-decoration would be beter. To do that, I assigned that style to a CSS class `done`, and for that class to be conditionally added to each item I had do use the nice ng-class directive:

 	ng-class="{done: utils.isTodoDone(item)}

This directive adds the class based on the value returned by the `isTodoDone` function, and was used in more places, like on selecting the filter type.

### Checkbox Customization

For the layout I predicted, the browser's standard checkbox was too small and not adequate to the design, so I did some customizing. The technique I used is quite well known, basically given that a `<label>` element for the input is present (and properly connected): 

* a container is needed so that a `position: relative` can be used to position the new checkbox
* the `<input>` element will have `display: none` 
* the `<label>` element will behave as the new checkbox
* a pseudo-element `:after` is added to the `<label>`, and it will represent the 'tick'

A nice note on this is that the 'tick' is simply a rectangle, rotated 45 degrees and with no right and top borders :) . The result is the following pen:

### 'To Do' Cleaning

With the dual binding AngularJS gives us, this task is as easy as setting up a *cleaner* function and assign it to a button with the ng-click directive:

	    $scope.cleanSelected = function() {
	        for (var i = 0; i < $scope.todos.length; i++) {
	            var todo = $scope.todos[i];
	            if (todo.done === true) {
	                $scope.todos.splice(i, 1);
	                i--;
	            }
	        }
	        saveData();
	    };


### 'To Do' Filtering

To filter the items based on their state, I decided to make clicking on each filter to change a scope variable that defines the filter type, like `ng-click="filterType=\'all\'`. In order to only represent the correct items on the `ng-repeat` directive, I had to filter the results based on a function scope I defined:

	<todo ng-repeat="item in todosFiltered = (getTodos() | filter:filterElements) track by item.id" />

And

    $scope.filterElements = function(el) {
        if ($scope.filterType === 'all' ) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return ((el.done === true && $scope.filterType === 'done') || (el.done === false && $scope.filterType === 'active'));
        }
    };

### Using Local Storage

Using the browser's local storage is pretty easy. I created 2 functions, **saveData** (which executes on each update) and **recoverData** (which runs on start up). These functions basically use the **getItem** and **setItem** of the localStorage API, parsing from/to JSON/String.

		recoverData = function() {
			if (localStorage) {
				$scope.todos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('jstodos')) || [];
			}
		};

		saveData = function() {
			if (localStorage) {
				localStorage.setItem('jstodos',JSON.stringify($scope.todos));
			}
		};

I put this simple app on the folowing pen, so you can see it at work:

<p data-height="708" data-theme-id="661" data-slug-hash="tmirz" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/capelo/pen/tmirz'>ToDo</a> by António Capelo (<a href='http://codepen.io/capelo'>@capelo</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

This time I used the cool [Yeoman}(http://yeoman.io/), which helped on bootstraping the app, provides a nice directory structure and eases the setup and running of the Jasmine test on Karma. I'll leave some thoughts on that for a future post.


See you soon,
