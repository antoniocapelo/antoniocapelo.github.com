#jekyll-based blog

This marks the day when I dropped my wordpress blog and started to create this jekyll-based one. 

I'm really liking the simplicity yet the freedom it gives us to quickly post from the terminal.
At the same time, it's a nice way to get used to use git more often and become fluent with its workflow.
